# 🍅 My Pomodoro Timer

Hey there! Tired of getting distracted every 5 minutes? Yeah, me too. So I built this little Pomodoro timer to help us actually get stuff done.

## What's This Thing Do?

It's pretty simple - work for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break, repeat. The classic Pomodoro technique that actually works (when you stick to it 😅).

## How to Use It

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Hit "Start" 
3. Actually focus on your work (the hard part)
4. Take your break when it tells you to
5. Repeat until you're done or your brain melts

Pro tip: Hit the spacebar to start/pause. Your mouse will thank you.
